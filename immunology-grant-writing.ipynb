It showcases the process of loading a PDF file, extracting and splitting its text, creating an index in Pinecone, generating embeddings using OpenAI, and conducting a similarity search based on a user query. The results are then displayed in a visually appealing HTML format. The purpose of this notebook is to illustrate an effective method for retrieving relevant information from a collection of documents using modern language models and vector search techniques.\n"

        "* **openai**: The official Python library for the OpenAI API, which provides access to OpenAI's powerful AI models, such as GPT-3 and Codex. You can use this package to interact with these models for various tasks, like text completion, summarization, translation, and more.\n",
        "* **pinecone-client**: The Python client for Pinecone, a managed vector database service. This package allows you to interact with Pinecone's vector database for tasks like similarity search, nearest neighbors, and more.\n",
