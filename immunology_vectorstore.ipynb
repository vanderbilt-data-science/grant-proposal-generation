The evidence showing that the immune system plays a central role in cancer development, either preventing or promoting cancer, is overwhelming. Investigations about the role of the immune system in cancer progression have led to specific clinical applications called “cancer immunotherapies,” which have shown unprecedented and sometimes even spectacular results, especially in cases of previously incurable cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been particularly explored in recent research and have led to the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo in 2018, \"for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.\" These advancements have convinced researchers working in all areas of cancer investigation and the lay public that it is indispensable to pay attention to the role of the immune system in cancer.')])"

Despite significant advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment, current therapies have limitations, and cancer remains a leading cause of death. In recent years, research on the role of the immune system in cancer has expanded, and there is growing evidence that the immune system plays a crucial role in cancer development, progression, and treatment. Understanding the complex interactions between cancer cells and the immune system is essential to develop effective cancer therapies.\\n\\nThe goal of this grant proposal is to advance our understanding of cancer immunology by investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the immune system's response to cancer. We aim to identify novel targets for cancer immunotherapy and develop innovative approaches for cancer treatment that exploit the immune system's potential. Our research will focus on studying the immune system's role in different types of cancer, including solid tumors and liquid tumors, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the immune system's contribution to cancer development and progression.\\n\\nWe believe that our research will have a significant impact on cancer treatment and patient outcomes. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of cancer immunology, we hope to develop effective therapies that can improve patient survival and quality of life.
